## Note-taking application

A note-taking application made with ReactJS, react-router and Redux for educational purposes only. You can create as many notes as you want, each onde with a title, category and content. Write anything you want! Then you can see all the notes you've created in a list. Clicking in a single note will give you the ability to read more informations and even delete it.

## How to run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can do this with your terminal or downloading a ZIP file.
    * If you choose the terminal way, you should click the Clone or download green button in this page, copy the url and in your terminal type: 'git clone pasteURL'

2. Now that you have the project in your local machine, go into the project's folder (through your terminal, by doing cd project's path) and run the command 'npm install'. This will install the dependencies needed for this project.

3. After thatm you are ready to run the command 'npm start'. By doing so, you will be able to run a local server, probably based on PORT 8080 (check your terminal). Then, you just have to go into any browser and type 'localhost:8080'

4. Hopefully you can see the application running :smile:

## Learnings

As the main goal of this application was to learn more about ReactJS, I will point out some of the interesting concepts I was able to learn:

* Redux and redux-promise
* Middleware concepts
* react-router-dom properties
* Routes and dynamic components
* Libraries like axios and lodash
* Form validation

## Tribute

This project was based on a Stephen Grider course named 'Modern React with Redux'. Also, the boilerplate structure was cloned from his github repository [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider)

Thank you Stephen!
